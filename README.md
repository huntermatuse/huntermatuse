# I’m @huntermatuse
always be knolling

I am graduated from UNC Wilmington with a B.S. of Business Adminstration with a focus on Information Systems and a Minor in Cyber Security.

I work in Operational Technology environments 👷🏼 with Global Process Automation. I guess you can say I design networks and write software for GPA.
Most of my projects are Python based, but I have experience in C#, C, Swift, and R.
