# I’m @huntermatuse
always be knolling

I am a graduate from UNC Wilmington with a B.S. of Business Adminstration with a focus on Information Systems and a Minor in Cyber Security.

I work in Operational Technology environments 👷🏼 with Global Process Automation. I guess you can say I design networks and write software for GPA.
Most of my projects are Python based, but I have experience in Java, C#, C, Rust, and more Python.
I explore machine learning and what it can do for the OT space and have been working projects to make this more obtainable.
